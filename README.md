This project is an Excel add-in to read and write json files.  

The json file must contain a an array of objects, and no nested objects.
The property names will be imported to the first row in the excel sheet.
After that, each row in the excel file represents a single object from the json array.

The woorksheet can be exported to json with the same logic.
The first row conatins the property names.
The following rows each define one json object.
